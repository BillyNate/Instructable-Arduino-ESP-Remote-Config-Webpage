# Load Your Arduino/ESP Config Webpage From the Cloud

This is the code for [the instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Load-Your-ArduinoESP-Config-Webpage-From-the-Cloud).
The repository has two branches, `master` contains the code for the Arduino / ESP and `gh-pages` contains the code for the webpage.
Each commit in these branches matches a step from the instructable.

Feel free to create a pull request if you think something needs improving. But be aware, I'll probably rebase to keep the history simple.
